# Project Name
> Housing Price Prediction of Australia Data using Ridge and Lasso Regression


## General Information
-Required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
-This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 
-They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. 
-Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions
- Ridge Regression Scores : Alpha : 100, Train : 92.26, Test : 87.77
- Lasso Regression Scores : Alpha : 0.001, Train : 93.66, Test : 87.22
- In terms of scores there is no much difference which means can use either of the regularization techniques
- Would prefer Lasso because of Feature Eliminations
